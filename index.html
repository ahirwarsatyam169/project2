    <h1>Top 5 Best looking Faired Bikes!</h1>
    <p>The topic of discussing about which bikes are most beautiful depends on personal prefrences so its not right to say that this or that bike is the most beautiful among all the bikes. The bikes listed here are my personal prefrences and mine alone but I think that many of you would agree with me because of such beautiful bikes and the beauty that you cannot deny!!</p>
    <p>I didn't talk much about specs in this because my main focus was on the looks so if you want to know the specs you are free to search it!</p>

    <h2>1.Ducati Panigale V4R (Not the 2025 One) </h2>
    <img src="v4r.jpg" alt="">
    <p>This bike is the most beautiful among all bikes for me. The single sided swingarm which just looks wow and the tail section which we all know is the best among all bikes. The engine is 998cc which is so powerfull that it can reach upto 240.5 hp with full racing exhaust and racing oil.</p>
    <div class="h3">
        <h4>Three things which I like the most about this bike: </h4>
        <h4> 1. Tail section</h4>
        <h4> 2. Single sided swingarm</h4>
        <h4> 3. Front look (Headlights and its air intake vents which are attached with Headlights are just wow!)</h4>
    </div> 
    
    <h2>2. MV Agusta Superveloce 1000</h2>
    <img src="superveloce.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The MV Agusta Superveloce is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful bike among all. It doesn't only go fast with its 998cc engine which produces 212 hp with performance exhaust but the beauty that radiates from it. The MV Agusta Superveloce 800 also share same look but with different engine though both looks very beautiful! </p>
    <div class="h3">
    <h4>Three things which I like the most about this bike: </h4>
    <h4> 1. Tail section</h4>
    <h4> 2. Single sided swingarm</h4>
    <h4> 3. Front look (That beautiful look in front where only one circular headlight is present is just jawdropping!!)</h4>
    </div>

    
    <h2>3. GSX-R1000</h2>
    <img src="gsxr1000.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The Suzuki GSX-R1000 is also one of the most beautiful bikes in the world. Thought there is nothing so fancy in this bike in terms of looks but that's the thing which makes it look simple yet beautiful. The bike has a 999cc engine which produces 200hp and the thing besides its performance is how sleek it looks and the front headlight section and its air intake vents are just amazing!! </p>
    <div class="h3">
    <h4>Three things which I like the most about this bike: </h4>
    <h4> 1. The fairings (The sleek looks this bike fairings give is just next level!!)</h4>
    <h4> 2. Overall sleek look especailly with the white color of this bike make it look sharp, sleek and beautiful</h4>
    <h4> 3. Front look (The air intake vents and headlight position is very beautiful!!)</h4>
    </div>

    <h2>4. KTM RC8R</h2>
    <img src="rc8r.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The RC8R is known as one of the most brutal bikes as it doesn't has any electronics and even abs is not present in this bike but the thing which is present in it is the brutal power with 1195cc v-twin engine which produces 173 hp but that isn't the only highlight the main highlight is the look which is so brutal that it looks like a bike which is made for speed and its brutal acceleration is the thing which many riders cannot handle. The bike is Raw which gives the thrill of riding it!!</p>
    <div class="h3">
    <h4>Three things which I like the most about this bike: </h4>
    <h4> 1. The fairings</h4>
    <h4> 2. Tail section(the pillion seat level is high making it look amazing!)</h4>
    <h4> 3. Front look (That brutal yet beautiful look in front is just amazing!!)</h4>
    </div>
    
    
    <h2>5. BMW S1000RR (Sharkfin model)</h2>
    <img src="s1k.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The BMW S1000RR sharkfin is the one of the most beautiful bikes out there but its discontinued and the sharkfin discontinued in 2019 as BMW launched its new model but I personally like the sharkfin model the most.Though along with its looks it had a great engine of 999cc which produces 199hp. </p>
    <div class="h3">
    <h4>Three things which I like the most about this bike: </h4>
    <h4> 1. The fairings  ( One side shark fin is just.... so cool!!)</h4>
    <h4>2. Tail section ( the tail is sharp which increases the looks of this bike)</h4>
    <h4>3. Front look  ( The asymmetric headlights are just wow!!)</h4>
